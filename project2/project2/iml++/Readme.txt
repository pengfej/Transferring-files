IML++ (Iterative Methods Library) v. 1.2a

IML++ is a C++ templated library of modern 
iterative methods for solving both symmetric 
and nonsymmetric linear systems of equations. 
The algorithms are fully templated in that 
the same source code works for dense, sparse, 
and distributed matrices. Some of the numerical 
methods are presented in the book, 
Templates: Building Blocks for the Solution of Iterative Systems and include

Richardson Iteration
Chebyshev Iteration
Conjugate Gradient (CG)
Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS)
BiConjugate Gradient (BiCG)
BiConjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGSTAB)
Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES)
Quasi-Minimal Residual Without Lookahead (QMR)
The IML++ software also contains an optional test suite for sparse matrix computations, using SparseLib++.
